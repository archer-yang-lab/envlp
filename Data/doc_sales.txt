Sales


Description


A firm is attempting to evaluate the quality of its sales staff and is trying to find an examination or series of tests that may reveal the potential for good performance in sales.  The firm has selected a random sample of 50 sales people and has evaluated each on 3 measures of performance: growth of sales, profitability of sales, and new-account sales.  These measures have been converted to a scale, on which 100 indicates "average" performance.  Each of the 50 individuals took each of 4 tests, which purported to measure creativity, mechanical reasoning, abstract reasoning, and mathematical ability, respectively.
