function W = dgrad(dF,Y,H)
% DGRAD	Computes the tangent vector, W, which results from applying the
% 	geometrically correct hessian at the stiefel point,Y, to the
% 	tangent vector H.
%
%	W = DGRAD(Y,H)
%	Y is expected to satisfy Y'*Y = I
%	H is expected to satisfy H = tangent(Y,H0)
%	W will satisfy W = tangent(Y,W0)
%
% role	geometrized objective function, the is the routine called to apply
%	the covariant hessian of F to a tangent vector.  The analog is
%	W = A*H, here A is the hessian of F.
