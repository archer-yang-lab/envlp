The @cell directory README file
-------------------------------

This directory is included as an experimental augmentation to the
sg_min routines to allow them to operate on product Stiefel-Grassmann
manifolds.  The presence of the @cell subdirectory will cause certain
functions used by sg_min and matlab to be overloaded so that calls of
the form

[fn,Yn] = sg_min(Y)

will make sense when Y = {Y1 Y2 ... Yk} (a matlab cell-array)
where each matrix Yi satisfies Yi'*Yi = I(size(Yi'*Yi)).

It is expected that F.m, dF.m, and ddF.m be written with the syntax:
double = F(cell-array)
cell-array = dF(cell-array)
cell-array = ddF(cell-array,cell-array)
