The sgmin version 2.0 directory README file
-------------------------------------------


The matlab functions presented in this directory serve to implement
the function sg_min, for Stiefel-Grassmann optimization.  This is the
second version of this code, which has improved accuracy, a different
set of convergence criteria, and some bug-fixes.  Additionally, the
Polak- Ribiere conjugate gradient method is now available.

If the subdirectory examples/ is present, it contains several
subdirectories of sample F.m, dF.m, and ddF.m functions which
represent a variety of Stiefel-Grassmann problems.

If the subdirectory @cell/ is present, it contains special functions
which extend sg_min to product Stiefel-Grassmann manifolds.  More
details can be found in the file @cell/README

sg_min 2.3 edition
-------------------------------------------------------------

The sg_min 2.3 edition contains additional documentation in the
examples/jordan subdirectory to help the user selected parameters
for their particular problem.

Additionally, modifications to the sg_min code will eventually
cause its numerical behavior and results to diverge from that 
described in Chapter 8 of the Eigenvalue Templates book, in which
a previous version appears.  For that reason, the examples/ 
subdirectory will contain files of sample output which should be
obtainable by the current version whatever it is.

sg_min 2.4 edition
-------------------------------------------------------------

It has been a while since I have tried to maintain this.  I
have made some fixes to maintain compatability with matlab
(I have removed the flops count and I have replaced fmin with
fminbnd).

However, looking back at this code, now 5 years later, I was
surprised at some of the lame stuff it is doing.  If you are
an sg_min user and you agree that the implementations of Newton
and CG are lame, then tell me of your interest and I will try
to accomodate.
